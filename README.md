# WebProject

Our project focuses on creating customized websites designed specifically for florists, addressing a gap we've noticed in the market. We're motivated by the understanding that there's a clear shortage of specialized online platforms that cater to the specific requirements of flower shops. Our goal is to offer a sophisticated solution that not only highlights the beauty of floral arrangements but also simplifies the online representation of these businesses. With a strong emphasis on design and usability, we aim to enhance the online presence of florists, enabling them to thrive in the digital realm.
